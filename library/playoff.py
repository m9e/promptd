"""You are tasked with {task}.

{context}

You will use a "playoff" method to find the best solution.
Follow these steps carefully:

Step 1: Generate choices
Create a list of 32 distinct choices related to {task}. Each choice should reflect the given context and requirements. Be creative, but make sure the choices are clear and relevant to the task at hand.

Step 2: The Playoff Rounds

Round of 32: 
Pair the 32 choices into 16 matchups (pairs). Compare each pair and choose a winner based on:
{criteria}

Round of 16: 
Take the 16 winners from the first round and pair them into 8 matchups. Compare each pair, select a winner, and explain your reasoning.

Quarterfinals: 
Take the 8 remaining choices and form 4 matchups. Again, compare each pair, choose winners, and provide reasoning.

Semifinals: 
Compare the 4 remaining choices in 2 matchups. Select the best choice from each pair with reasoning.

Final Round: 
Compare the final 2 choices. Choose the overall best choice based on how well it meets the task requirements, its effectiveness, and other relevant factors. Provide a detailed explanation for why this choice stands out as the best.

Step 3: The Final Output
At the end of this playoff process, present:
- The complete list of the original 32 choices, ranked from best to worst, in order.
- The final chosen solution (the top-ranked choice).
- A detailed explanation for why the final choice was selected as the best out of all 32, considering the specific task and criteria.
